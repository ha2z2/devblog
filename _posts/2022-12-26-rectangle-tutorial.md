## Objective of the Game

The objective of the game is to draw lines along the grid edges to divide the grid into multiple rectangles. But by attempting to do so, the user/player must also ensure that each rectangle contains exactly one numbered square and that its corresponding area is equal to the number written in that particular square.

## Instructions / Guideline

Using your own mouse/trackpad, draw a rectangle by Clicking and/or Dragging from one grid corner to another, or from one square centre to another. You can also drag along a grid line to just draw a line at a time, or just click on a single grid edge to draw or erase it. 

The Original Interface looks like this

## Notes

    An Example of Completing the Rectangles Puzzle
        Serves as a General Guideline as well

Step 1: Start by filling out a block that has only one way of being set

- For example, here the 6 can only have the first row of six squares excluding the square with the 2 block filled

Step 2: Repeat the process done in Step 1, but now use the fact that some of the other completed rectangles have limited space for certain blocks

- We now know that the two eights have no other option but to fill as shown in the picture below

Step 3: Complete rest of the puzzle using the same/similar methods
