The main problem with creating an app that is able to execute a game like this is the limited amount of images that could be put to a GUI(Graphics User Interface) in a specific scenario such as this

Thus, the main component of this game (which I intended was the variety of customization available for the user) would not be able to succeed.

This is quite simple, but it maintains the primary and foremost most vital part of the App: Aiming/Helping to prevent Memory Loss (especially) for the elderly.

Though my solution limits the variety of options that could be implemented, this is a practical solution that allows a new, hybrid selection of variety(though not initially intended in this particular way).

## Words

By conducting further research on what selection of different words allow memory loss to be prevented, this game would become even more centered around preventing Alzheimer's disease.
